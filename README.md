# Kaggle Playground Series S4E5: Flood Prediction

This repository contains my implementation for the [2024 Kaggle Playground Series S4E5](https://kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5) competition. The goal of this competition is to predict the probability of a region flooding based on various factors using machine learning techniques.

## Competition Overview

The Tabular Playground Series provides an opportunity for the Kaggle community to practice and enhance their machine learning skills with interesting and approachable datasets. The competition runs from May 1, 2024, to May 31, 2024, and submissions are evaluated using the R2 score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this competition is synthetically generated to simulate real-world data while ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows for more interesting and realistic datasets for competition purposes. The dataset includes various features that may impact flood probability.

## Submission File Format

The submission file should contain the predicted probabilities of flooding for each region. It must have a header and follow this format:

## Implementation Details

In this repository, you'll find my approach to solving the flood prediction problem, which includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and selecting important ones.
3. **Modeling:** Training various machine learning models to predict flood probabilities.
4. **Evaluation:** Using the R2 score to evaluate model performance.
5. **Submission:** Generating the final submission file in the required format.
